# aoc - Advent of Code
Just a repository with solutions to questions on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) that I've answered and the code I used to do so.

### ⚠️There is a chance that these solutions only work with my inputs. None of these are meant to be the best or the cleanest. There are definitely better ways out there, these were just what I happened to use.
